## Application Name and Function

In a world driven by technology, the art of storytelling should be easily accessible to all. This is the vision that sparked the creation of "Book Haven." The founders, a diverse group of readers, writers, and tech enthusiasts, shared a common passion for literature. They envisioned a platform where writers could freely share their stories, and readers could explore a vast collection of books tailored to their tastes. Thus, "Book Haven" was born.

"Book Haven" isn't just a platform; it's a sanctuary for bibliophiles. Writers can showcase their literary creations, providing detailed descriptions to entice potential readers. Users, on the other hand, can easily find books that match their preferred genres, thanks to the innovative genre recommendation system.

Reviews, although a challenge, were deemed essential to ensure quality content and provide constructive feedback to authors. The team was up for the task, determined to implement this feature in a way that would enrich the reading experience for all. As the development progressed, the team introduced a range of features aimed at enhancing user engagement. From the 'Book Haven‚Äôs recommended Books' to the 'About Us' page, every element of the app was designed to foster a sense of community and appreciation for literature.

To cater to different roles within the platform, the team established three distinct user types: Administrators and readers. Administrators would oversee the entire operation, ensuring a safe and enriching environment for all. Readers would have the power to explore and engage with the content.

"Book Haven" wasn't just an assignment; it was a passion project. The team's dedication to promoting literacy and storytelling was evident in every line of code and every design choice. They believed that in a world inundated with information, a platform dedicated to the art of storytelling was not only necessary but vital.

And so, "Book Haven" was ready to embark on its journey, inviting writers, readers, and enthusiasts from all walks of life to join them in their literary haven. Together, they would create a space where stories thrived, and the love for books knew no bounds.

## Integration Flow

For the Mid-Semester Project, we developed BookHaven as a web application. Additionally, we implemented various endpoints to handle JSON data, essentially creating an API. This API will be utilized by our mobile application, which will send HTTP requests to the prepared endpoints. The goal is to seamlessly integrate BookHaven data from the web server into the mobile application.
